BLE ebook page turner with ESP32 &amp; Arduino IDE
</p><p>
This is a simple project for turning forward/backward page and back to bookshelf of ebook application through BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). I confirmed its operation with SONY Reader, Kinoppy, BOOK WALKER, Booklive, 読書尚友, なろうリーダ, which are all Android apps. This project is made with Arduino IDE on ESP32-WROOM-32E.
