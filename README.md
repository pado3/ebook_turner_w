BLE ebook page turner with ESP32 &amp; Arduino IDE
</p><p>
This is a simple project for turning forward/backward page and back to bookshelf of ebook application through BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). I confirmed its operation with SONY Reader, Kinoppy, BOOK WALKER, Booklive, 読書尚友, なろうリーダ, which are all Android apps. This project is made with Arduino IDE on ESP32-WROOM-32E.

I modified the page turner to make it an auxiliary device for playing videos in the web browser on the Raspberry Pi.
It has left and right arrow keys to skip videos, an escape key to leave the full screen mode, and a macro to launch Firefox.</p><p>
